The Ministry of Transportation has introduced a range of measures to maintain this record and to improve the behaviour of all drivers.Most collisions are caused by driver error or behaviours such as following too closely, speeding, failure to yield the right of way, improper turns, running red lights and frequently changing lanes. There are also drivers who intentionally put others at risk through such reckless behaviour. Statistics show that new drivers of all ages are far more likely than experienced drivers to be involved in serious or fatal collisions.Provincial campaigns promoting the correct use of seatbelts and child car seats, and informing people about drinking and driving and aggressive driving, are making a difference. Ontario’s Graduated Licensing System (GLS), which lets new drivers gain skills and experience in low-risk environments, is also helping to develop better, safer drivers.This handbook gives new drivers the basic information they need about learning to drive in Ontario: the rules of the road, safe driving practices and how to get a licence to drive a car, van or small truck. The ministry recommends that all drivers would benefit from taking an advanced course in driver training.As you read, remember that this handbook is only a guide. For official descriptions of the laws, look in the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario and its Regulations. Information on how to get licences to drive other types of vehicles is available in Part Two of this handbook, the Official MTO Motorcycle Handbook, the Official MTO Truck Handbook, the Official MTO Bus Handbook and the Official MTO Air Brake Handbook.Drive safely.The Ministry of Transportation strives to be a world leader in moving people and goods safely, efficiently and sustainably to support a globally competitive economy and a high quality of life.There are many ways to contact the Government of Ontario.Ontario.ca needs JavaScript to function properly and provide you with a fast, stable experience.To have a better experience, you need to:What you need to know about government-approved driving schools and where to find them.Government-approved driving schools can help you become a safe and responsible driver.

You will be required to show your certificate to enforcement or police officers during an inspection.You should get a CVOR certificate before you register your vehicle with ServiceOntario if you have never registered a commercial vehicle in Ontario before.The CVOR program monitors and evaluates operators’ safety records.

When you register your vehicle with ServiceOntario and get your licence plate, you must declare a registered gross weight (RGW) that will be used to determine your registration fees.When you register your vehicle, you should select a RGW that is high enough to account for the heaviest load you plan to carry (remember to account for the vehicle, its load and a trailer if applicable).It is illegal to operate a vehicle with a gross weight that is higher than its RGW. If you need to carry a load that is heavier than your vehicle’s RGW, you will need to visit a ServiceOntario centre to update your vehicle’s registration.If you don’t know the gross weight of your vehicle and load, you may be able to bring it to certain truck stops or municipal facilities, which have a public scale, to determine the weight on each axle or axle grouping. Be sure to contact them ahead of time to make sure they can accommodate you.A trailer and its load are considered part of your vehicle’s gross weight if together they weigh more than 2,800 kg (6,171 lb). If the trailer and its load weigh less than 2,800 kg then your gross weight is only the weight of the vehicle and its load (including the driver, passengers, fuel, equipment, tools, cargo, equipment and other items in the truck).Follow these steps to determine your total gross weight with a trailer:Weigh your trailer and its load together (weight A). Weigh your vehicle and its load (weight B). If the trailer and its load (weight A) is more than 2,800 kg (6,171 lb), then your vehicle’s gross weight includes the trailer, the vehicle and their loads (weight A+B).If the trailer is 2,800 kg or less then your vehicle’s gross weight is only the vehicle and its load (weight B).A CVOR operator (also referred to as a “carrier”) is the person or corporation responsible for the operation of the commercial motor vehicle, driver and goods or passengers being transported including:Learn more about Ontario’s commercial vehicle safety requirements. Every operator is assigned one of five ratings based on their safety performance:Your safety rating is available to the public and can affect your ability to promote your business and attract customers.If your safety performance doesn’t meet Ontario’s standards, you may face interventions such as:An “Unsatisfactory” safety rating will cause your operating privileges to be suspended or cancelled throughout Canada. The Ministry of Transportation audits operators to evaluate safety practices and compliance with Ontario’s highway safety legislation. A facility audit is a formal intervention to determine carrier safety ratings, interventions and sanctions.A facility audit will include an examination of records related to:The auditor will present their findings to the operator at the end of an audit.

It showed that the roads were open and we set out on our 3 hour trip.  Visibility was good, roads were plowed.  We got 2 hours into the trip only to find multiple barricades and road closures that were not posted.  We then took back roads which were open but not plowed as well as the main roads.  Very disappointed in this app.  Useless.The app itself is useful. It provides road closure, traffic, hazards and other info. Accessing traffic cameras is also useful (even though it would be helpful if they indicated which way the cameras were facing, so you could know which lanes were N/S or E/W). The only reason why Iâm rating 4 stars is because of the pointless animations on the map and menu page that are distracting and detract from the app experience.

Ontario generates 37% of the national GDP and is home to almost 50% of all employees in high tech, financial services and other knowledge-intensive industries”.Learn more about Ontario’s highly diversified economyOntario lies in the core of the North American Free Trade area, which includes more than 460 million people and generates a combined gross domestic product of more than $18 trillion (purchasing power parity, current international $). In 2011, more than C$ 1.4 billion crossed the Canada-U.S. border each day and Ontario-US trade accounted for approximately C$ 716 million of that amount.Ontario is part of the North American manufacturing heartland. Examples of Ontario's key manufacturing industries include autos, information and communications technologies, biotech, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.Here are some key facts about Ontario’s manufacturing sector:Ontario has more than half of the highest quality (“Class 1”) farm land in Canada. There are 51,950 farms in Ontario (Census of Agriculture, 2011) and they make up almost one-quarter of all farm revenue in Canada.Ontario’s agricultural production includes:Ontario’s forests play a major role in the province’s economy. They contribute to a good standard of living by supporting more than 53,000 direct jobs in the forest industry (2011). In total, the forestry sector supports almost 200,000 direct and indirect jobs across 260 Ontario communities.Mineral production in Ontario was more than $10 billion in 2011. The mining industry in Ontario is a global leader in productivity and has world leading environmental standards. Ontario is among the top 10 producers in the world for nickel and platinum group metals. The province is also a significant producer of gold, copper, zinc, cobalt and silver. Southern Ontario produces non-metallic minerals including salt, gypsum, lime, nephelinesyenite and structural materials (sand, gravel, stone). The sedimentary rocks of the south are also the site of Ontario's oil and gas industry.Although Ontario is a manufacturing powerhouse, the services sector is the largest part of Ontario's economy.

Before the arrival of the European settlers, Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking Aboriginals had settled on the land.Experts aren’t sure about the exact translation of “Ontario”.  They know “Ontario” comes from an Iroquois word for beautiful water, beautiful lake or big body of water.Beginning in the 1600s, French and British settlers arrived in Canada and began to work the land. After the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), most of the land in Canada belonged to the British. The British called this area the province of Quebec, which included Quebec, Ontario and part of the United States.After the American Revolution (1775-1783), many American colonists who were loyal to Britain moved to Ontario. They were known as United Empire Loyalists. Many Iroquois also moved to Upper Canada from northern New York State.In 1791, the British enacted the Constitutional Act, which split Quebec into two parts. Ontario was upstream of the St. Lawrence River so it became Upper Canada and Quebec became Lower Canada.Upper Canada’s first capital was Newark, which is now Niagara-on-the-Lake. In 1793, the capital was moved to York (now Toronto) to protect it from American attacks. Upper Canada’s first Lieutenant Governor was General John Graves Simcoe.Throughout the nineteenth century, many immigrant groups moved to Upper Canada, including Germans, Scots and Mennonites. By 1830, the population of Canada was about 235,000.  Toronto became the first city in Ontario in 1834.In 1867, Ontario and Quebec became separate provinces.  They joined Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form a federal union called the Dominion of Canada. This was declared in the British North America Act. The new country’s capital was the small town of Ottawa and the first prime minister was Sir John A. Macdonald.Ontario is Canada's second largest province, covering more than 1 million square kilometres (415,000 square miles) - an area larger than France and Spain combined. Ontario is bounded by Quebec  to the east, Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes to the south.Here are some key facts about Ontario’s geography:Ontario’s varied landscape offers an abundance of natural resources. Learn more about these resources below:Ontario's many lakes, rivers and streams played a central role in the province's history and development. For Aboriginal peoples and the early European settlers, the lakes and rivers were a means of transportation and a source for food. Waterways determined the patterns of settlement as well as the patterns of industrialization.Here are some key facts about water in Ontario:70 million hectares – or 66% of Ontario’s land – is classified as forested land. By area, these forests represent about 18% of Canada's forests and 2% of the world's forests. Harvested wood is used to make building materials, pulp and paper and a wide range of other value-added products, such as furniture and flooring.But there is more than one kind of forest in Ontario. These include the deciduous forest of southern Ontario and the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Forest of central Ontario. Northern Ontario is home to both the Boreal forest and the Hudson Bay Lowlands forest. A very small region of southern Ontario also includes Carolinian forest, which is home to the Kentucky coffee and sassafras trees – both species that can’t be found anywhere else in Canada!Ontario's varied climate and geography support habitat for more than 3,600 species of plants, 154 species of fish, 50 species of amphibians and reptiles, 483 species of birds, and more than 81 species of mammals. In Ontario's southernmost regions, you will find prickly pear cactus and sassafras trees, while polar bears roam our northern tundra.Common fish in Ontario include yellow perch, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. The mammals that call Ontario home include beavers, black bears, muskrats, gray wolves, white-tailed deer and walrus. Familiar birds include blue jays, northern cardinals, great blue herons, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls and pileated woodpeckers.

Since then, Ontario's provincial parks have stood for protection of the natural environment and enjoyment of the great outdoors. Today, Ontario's vast system of parks and protected areas totals over 9 million hectares, and includes areas of magnificent old-growth forest, woodland caribou ranges, wilderness rivers, wetlands and habitat for rare and endangered plants and animals.Our parks attract about 10 million visitors each year and provide places for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, swimming, canoeing, nature viewing and fishing. Parks are also important for scientific research, environmental monitoring and outdoor education. Most importantly, Ontario's provincial parks will protect and conserve our rich natural and cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations.Learn more about Ontario's parksSince Ontario’s first gold rush in 1866 near the town of Madoc, Ontario has been Canada’s leading metals producer.
